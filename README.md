# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project generates a webpage displaying a team's basic information, which is entered by the user through the console via Inquirer.js. Members of the team consist of a Manager plus any number of Engineers and Interns. All team members have a name, id and email address. In addition, managers have an office number, engineers have a github username and interns have a school. After entering all team member's information, the user can select a name for the team and the webpage. The email addresses and github usernames are rendered with hyperlinks.
